## Description
This is #3 of the Series of Spectacularly Silly (yet fun!) websites to come. 
This is also hands down the site I had the least fun making so far. My original inspiration came from stumbling across @harlanhaskins looping images code and I immediately had a vision of a dancing PSY. I tried coding a colourchanging dancefloor but it was really hard. That's pretty much it yeah.

## Key Learnings
* Understanding and implementing code written by someone else
* Chrome actually disabled autoplay when you embed an <audio> file on sites a few years ago
* Played a lot with PaperJS and VantaJS (though I used neither for this particular project)

## Acknowledgments
I also would like to credit my really cool CS Professor Debayan Gupta (again) for being the reason behind my interest in CS. 
Lastly, I would like to thank my best friend "smol gurl" for being my biggest inspiration.
